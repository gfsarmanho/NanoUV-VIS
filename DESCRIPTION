Description: R package containing a shiny web interactive application that provides
             visualization tool for monitoring the evolution of optical properties
             of nanoparticles throughout synthesis reactions. Uploading multiple 
             ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) absorbance spectra it is
             possible to interactively analyse reactions aspects throughout
             different plots in two and three dimentions.
